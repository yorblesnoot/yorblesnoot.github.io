              Hi! I'm Eduardo "Ed" Korb and I'm a software developer for-hire. Before that I was a technical writer, editor, and tutor in algebra/calculus/physics/geometry/SAT/GRE/english/spanish/logic/other stuff I've forgotten!
              I majored in philosophy at the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras and I've been pretty much doing whatever since.

              <div>All that to say that I'll leap at any chance to learn something new, and I love to share information with my fellow travelers!
                If you're looking for a quick study, a deep and eclectic pool of knowledge, and a touch of whimsicalityâ€”I'm your guy!</div>
              <div style={{fontSize:'.7em'}}>But seriously, if you have employment opportunities please reach out!</div>
            </div>
